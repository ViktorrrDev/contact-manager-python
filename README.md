# Contact Manager

A simple command-line Contact Manager written in Python. This project allows users to manage their personal contacts with basic operations such as adding, viewing, searching, and deleting contacts.

## Features

- Add new contacts (name, phone number, email)
- View the list of saved contacts
- Search contacts by name
- Delete contacts by name
- User-friendly CLI menu

## How It Works

This script uses a class called `ContactBook` (imported from the `contact_book` module) to manage contact information. The user interacts with the program through a simple text-based menu.

## File Structure
contact_manager.py # Main script with menu and interaction logic
contact_book.py # Module that contains the ContactBook class


## Usage

Make sure you have Python installed and follow on-screen menu options. Then, run the main script:

```bash
python contact_manager.py

## Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries are needed
